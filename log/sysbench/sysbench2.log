sysbench 0.4.12:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1

Doing OLTP test.
Running mixed OLTP test
Doing read-only test
Using Special distribution (12 iterations,  1 pct of values are returned in 75 pct cases)
Using "LOCK TABLES READ" for starting transactions
Using auto_inc on the id column
Maximum number of requests for OLTP test is limited to 100000
Threads started!
Done.
